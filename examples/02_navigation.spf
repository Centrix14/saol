~ (saol is focused on array processing, so it has tools for navigating arrays)

:123 ~ (initially, the array element pointer is set to 0 element, so this string initializes the 0 cell with the value 123)
>:456 ~ (command `>` moves the pointer 1 forward)
< ~ (similarly, the command ` > ' moves the pointer back 1)
^45 ~ (the ` ^ ' command sets the pointer to a specific position, here in cell 45)
